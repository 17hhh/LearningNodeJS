# LearningNodeJS


Source code to accompany my book, "Learning Node.JS"

## Errors and Corrections

As devastating as it is to admit, there are a couple of errors in the book.
Those responsible for these egregious violations of editorial process (me)
have been shot.

### Chapter 8

_p176._  At the top of the page, the `.sort("date")` should read `.sort(sort)`

### Chapter 11

_p249._ There are two lines of the format:

```
var data = process.stdXXX.read();
```

These should read:
```
var data = node.stdXXX.read();
```
